Limitations of current approaches

    - no provision for router reboots to learn previously delegated prefixes
    - no provision for multiple prefixes delegated from multiple routers
    - no support for provisioning domains [RFC7556]

want to preserve the security afforded by RA guard [citation], so don't
limit the new protocol to follow RAs closely.

don't modify RA directly, to more easily support network extension on shared
links.

New ND option: Network Extension
subtype:
    - Solicitation (NES)
    - Assignment (NEA)
    - Report (NER)

NES:
    - sent to routers whose RAs we've processed and accepted
    - MUST be unicast
    - contains either one or more DP options or a PVD option with
      one or more DP options (but not both?)

NEA:
    - sent to NES, unicast

NER:
    - sent to NES, unicast, or sent to ff02::requesting_routers
    - nodes MUST drop NERs that are from routers from which they
      have not yet received, processed and accepted a RA

    - reponse is to to start NES for that router
